# Mergesort with parallel excecution

Sorting algorithm are basic features of modern programming languages.This is an implementation of mergesort in cpp.In tests directory I have compared the excecution speed of mergesort ,cstdlib quicksort,and std::sort(introsort) for various sized arrays.They have been tested with multithreading(except qsort).

### System specification

It is been tested on 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12650H (2.30 GHz) processor,16.0 GB (15.7 GB usable) installed RAM, on WSL2 Ubuntu with windows 11 

### mergesort vs std::sort vs cstdlib qsort
